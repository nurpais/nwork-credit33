                          <p>
                            I walked into Credit Thirty3 not knowing where to start with my loan. I wasn't sure what
                            rate I should expect. Thankfully, the loan officer had me covered and was there every step
                            of the way!
                          </p>

                  With effect from 1 October 2015, the maximum interest rate moneylenders can charge is 4% per month.
                  This cap applies regardless of the borrower’s income and whether the loan is an unsecured or secured
                  one. If a borrower fails to repay the loan on time, the maximum rate of late interest a moneylender
                  can charge is 4% per month for each month the loan is repaid late.
                  <br /><br />
                  The computation of interest charged on the loan must be based on the amount of principal remaining
                  after deducting from the original principal the total payments made by or on behalf of the borrower
                  which are appropriated to principal. [To illustrate, if X takes a loan of $10,000, and X has repaid
                  $4,000, only the remaining $6,000 can be taken into account for the computation of interest.
